# Thermostat App

Don't really feel like there should be much here. Some screenshots, maybe a little explanation. But overall, just go download the version you need from the releases and run it. As long as your server and thermostat are working, it should work just fine. 

This is one of the thermostat in the between_states mode. After having run a previous mode. Polling to see if it needs another state change.
